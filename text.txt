The function read() attempts to read nbyte bytes of data from the object 
referenced by the descriptor fildes into the buffer pointed to by buf.
The read() function starts at a position given by the pointer associated
with fildes. At the end, the pointer is incremented by the number of 
bytes (nbyte) actually read.
